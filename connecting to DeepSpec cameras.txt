When setting up a new computer with a DeepSpec camera, one must first set up the ethernet adaptor's IP address. 
Typically, IP assignment is performed dynamically. The DeepSpec cameras are configured using a static IP address. The default network settings for a cemra are the following: 

IP address: 192.168.1.234
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Server Port: 12345 (TCP)


The only camera that can connect using the Greateyes software are the ones with 192.168.1.234. However, when connecting simultaneously to more than one camera, we must assign a different address to each detector. I have done this using 192.168.1.231 - 192.168.1.234. The connection is done using the python SDK of the camera, wrapped by either my code or Arie's version. 

Either way, one must configure the computer to have an IP address with 192.168.1.xxx so that xxx is different than all cameras. I typically use 235. 

For the other definition use: 

subnet mask (or subnet bit length): 255.255.255.0 (or 24)

DNS: 8.8.8.8
alternate DNS: 8.8.4.4


Once the IP is configured properly, you can check the camera is connected. Simply enter the detector IP address in a browser (or type "ping 192.168.1.234" in the winkey+R, cmd terminal). The browser should open a Greateyes configuration page for the detector (user: admin, pass: greateyes). this is where you can change the IP address of the detector unit, and see its serial number and other settings. 


Once a Detector is connected (either using the sdk or the software), one should know that the detectors open a websocket that doesn't close properly if the connection terminates unexpectedly. This blocks the user from opening a new connection until the power is cut to the detector. If this happens, shut down the power and restart the cameras.
